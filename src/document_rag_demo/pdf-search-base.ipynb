It served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who\\nruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom.\\nBuilt c. 2600 BC,[3] over a period of about 26 years,[4]\\nthe pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the\\nAncient World, and the only wonder that has\\nremained largely intact. It is the most famous\\nmonument of the Giza pyramid complex, which is\\npart of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Memphis\\nand its Necropolis\".[5] It is situated at the northeastern\\nend of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.\\nInitially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great\\nPyramid was the world\\'s tallest human-made structure\\nfor more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the\\nsmooth white limestone casing was removed, which\\nlowered the pyramid\\'s height to the current 138.5\\nmetres (454.4 ft); what is seen today is the underlying\\ncore structure. The base was measured to be about\\n230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of\\nroughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic\\nfeet), which includes an internal hillock.[6] The\\ndimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits\\n(146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits\\n(230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of  51\\n2  palms (a slope\\nof 51°50\\'40\").\\nThe Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an\\nestimated 2.3 million large blocks, weighing 6 million\\ntonnes in total. The majority of the stones are not\\nuniform in size or shape, and are only roughly\\ndressed.[7] The outside layers were bound together by\\nmortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza\\nPlateau was used for its construction. Other blocks\\nwere imported by boat on the Nile: white limestone\\nfrom Tura for the casing, and blocks of granite from\\nAswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the \"King\\'s\\nChamber\" structure.[8]'),\n",

Qos is identifiable with Kaush\\n(Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from\\nthe Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and\\ncrescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable\\nthat the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There\\nis continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus: bow) who has been\\nidentified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god)\\nalthough the crescent above the stele is also a bow.\\nNabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat\\n(god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in\\nSinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-\\'allahi: \"god decided\" (Greek Garamelos) and\\nAush-allahi: \"gods covenant\" (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi \"Allah is peace\" and Shalm-allat, \"the peace\\nof the goddess\". We also find Amat-allahi \"she-servant of god\" and Halaf-llahi \"the successor of Allah\".[64]\\nRecently, Petra has been put forward as the original direction of Muslim prayer, the Qibla, by some that the earliest\\nmosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca.[65] This view is also shared by Abdullah Hashem, the self-proclaimed\\nQa\\'im of the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light.[66] However, others have challenged the notion of comparing\\nmodern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques’ Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately\\ncalculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may\\nwell be coincidental.[67]\\nThe Monastery, Petra\\'s largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was\\ndedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god.\\nThis information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the\\ntranslation of the Arabic Ad Deir).\\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of\\nKing Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra\\'s so-called Sacred\\nQuarter, an area situated at the end of Petra\\'s main Colonnaded Street consisting\\nof two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the\\nWinged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\\nChristianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade\\ncentre. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian Emperor of Rome took\\nover, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine The Great. He began the initial spread of Christianity throughout\\nthe Roman Empire. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the\\n\"tomb with the urn\"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most\\nholy bishop Jason\" (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way\\nto Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the\\nsecond fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Château de la Valée de Moyse or\\nSela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189.[24] It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[68]\\nAccording to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth,\\nand where Moses\\' brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The\\nWadi Musa or \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A\\nmountaintop shrine of Moses\\' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its\\nlocation has not been identified since.[69]'),\n",

He describes the\\nmaking and operation of screws to raise water in his garden.[34]\\nThe descriptions of the classical authors fit closely to these contemporary records. Before\\nthe Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC Alexander the Great camped for four days near the\\naqueduct at Jerwan.[35] The historians who travelled with him would have had ample time to\\ninvestigate the enormous works around them, recording them in Greek. These first-hand\\naccounts have not survived into modern times, but were quoted by later Greek writers.\\nKing Sennacherib\\'s garden was well-known not just for its beauty – a year-round oasis of lush green in a\\ndusty summer landscape – but also for the marvelous feats of water engineering that maintained the\\ngarden.[36] There was a tradition of Assyrian royal garden building. King Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 BC)\\nhad created a canal, which cut through the mountains. Fruit tree orchards were planted. Also mentioned\\nwere pines, cypresses and junipers; almond trees, date trees, ebony, rosewood, olive, oak, tamarisk,\\nwalnut, terebinth, ash, fir, pomegranate, pear, quince, fig, and grapes. A sculptured wall panel of\\nAssurbanipal shows the garden in its maturity. One original panel[37] and the drawing of another[38] are\\nheld by the British Museum, although neither is on public display. Several features mentioned by the\\nclassical authors are discernible on these contemporary images.\\nOf Sennacherib\\'s palace, he mentions the massive limestone\\nblocks that reinforce the flood defences. Parts of the palace were\\nexcavated by Austin Henry Layard in the mid-19th century. His\\ncitadel plan shows contours which would be consistent with\\nSennacherib\\'s garden, but its position has not been confirmed. The\\narea has been used as a military base in recent times, making it\\ndifficult to investigate further.\\nThe irrigation of such a garden demanded an upgraded water\\nsupply to the city of Nineveh. The canals stretched over 50\\nkilometres (31 mi) into the mountains. Sennacherib was proud of\\nthe technologies he had employed and describes them in some detail on his inscriptions. At the headwater\\nof Bavian (Khinnis)[39] his inscription mentions automatic sluice gates. An enormous aqueduct crossing\\nthe valley at Jerwan was constructed of over two million dressed stones. It used stone arches and\\nwaterproof cement.[40] On it is written:\\nSennacherib king of the world king of Assyria. Over a great distance I had a watercourse\\ndirected to the environs of Nineveh, joining together the waters.... Over steep-sided valleys I\\nspanned an aqueduct of white limestone blocks, I made those waters flow over it.\\nSennacherib claimed that he had built a \"Wonder for all Peoples\", and said he was the first to deploy a\\nnew casting technique in place of the \"lost-wax\" process for his monumental (30 tonne) bronze castings.\\nHe was able to bring the water into his garden at a high level because it was sourced from further up in\\nthe mountains, and he then raised the water even higher by deploying his new water screws. This meant\\nhe could build a garden that towered above the landscape with large trees on the top of the terraces – a\\nstunning artistic effect that surpassed those of his predecessors.')],\n",
